# Halloween Candy Data
### Context
How do we feel about different candies when we receive them in our Halloween haul? What's the average age of people who are going out trick or treating vs. those who aren't? Do females and males have the same favorite candy? And, how our tastes differ across different countries or change over the years? 
These are the questions that the analysis attempts to answer.

### Format of Raw Data
The Halloween data comes in the form of three messy data tables. Each table stores data from the Candy Hierarchy survey per single year (2015, 2016, 2017).

### Approach to Data Cleaning
Before creating a single dataset (done for each table separately)

* clean variable names
* exclude variables not needed for data analysis
* reorganise columns and rows (make dataset longer)
* add an extra column with a year value
* bind three data tables vertically

After binding to a single dataset

* unify casing for all the text data
* clean country column - unify the text entries of per particular country
* clean age column - extract first numerical value, convert to numerical, and change unreasonable entries to the missing value represented by NA

### Findings
1. The clean dataset corresponds to a total of 689203 candy ratings. 

2. The average age of people going trick or treating vs. those who aren't, doesn't differ significantly.

3. People don't have strong feelings when receiving lollipops in the Halloween haul. But people are felt with joy when given any full-sized candy bar, and in particular, Reese's peanut butter cups make them happy. On the other size, people despair getting gums from baseball cards.

4. Some people despair Starburst, it received exactly 1990 despair rankings.

5. Both males and females are equally most pleased when they receive any full-sized candy bar, and in particular, Reese's peanut butter cups brings them joy.

6. Reese's peanut butter cups were the most popular candy bar in 2015 and 2017, but Kit Kat was the most popular candy in 2016.

7. Over the year, the most popular candy bar in Canada was Kit Kat. In the UK, it was Lindt truffle. In the USA, the winner was Reese's peanut butter cups, which seems to be the overall favourite across other countries in the dataset.

## Dirty Data Project - tasks

### Task 1 - Decathlon Data

1. Clean the detaset (This dataset has row names)

1. Who had the longest long jump seen in the data?
2. What was the average 100m time in each competition?
3. Who had the highest total points across both competitions?
4. What was the shot-put scores for the top three competitors in each competition?
5. What was the average points for competitors who ran the 400m in less than 50 seconds vs. those than ran 400m in more than 50 seconds?

### Task 4 - Halloween Candy Data

1. Clean data and combine three datasets together.

1. What is the total number of candy ratings given across the three years. (number of candy ratings, not number of raters. Donâ€™t count missing values)
2. What was the average age of people who are going out trick or treating and the average age of people not going trick or treating?
3. For each of joy, despair and meh, which candy bar revived the most of these ratings?
4. How many people rated Starburst as despair?

For the next three questions, count despair as -1, joy as +1 and meh as 0.

6. What was the most popular candy bar by this rating system for each gender in the dataset?
7. What was the most popular candy bar in each year?
8. What was the most popular candy bar by this rating for people in US, Canada, UK and all other countries?
